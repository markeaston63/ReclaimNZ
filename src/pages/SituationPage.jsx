            <p>
            People are asking "why doesn't 'somebody' do something about the push toward full tribal Sovereignty?"
            </p>
            <p>
            RECENT EXAMPLES:
            </p>     
            <p>
                1) As a result of John Key's Gov't our whole Coastline is under threat with  580 overlapping tribal claims - some months back the present Coalition Gov't were looking into tightening up the claimant requirements, but they are now procrastinating and say it will be sometime in the future before they come up with anything - meanwhile activist Judges are still awarding tribes more of our coastline, the recent claim passed on13th June 2025 for a section of the Kapiti Coast.
            </p>  
            <p>
                2) Nga Tahu have a claim before the High Court for control of the freshwater resources of the South Island.
            </p>         
            <p>
                3) Erica Stanford fails to remove treaty clauses in the Education and Training Amendment Bill No2, it appears she endorses them.
            </p>       
            <p>
                4) The most recent and alarming example is a group of tribes have filed proceedings in the High Court for control of all the freshwater resources in New Zealand.
            </p>     
            <p>
                The fact is that it is only our elected politicians that can fix this problem, and for 50 years they (both major political parties) have been complicit in advancing tribal interests, therefore it is our elected MPs that we have to pressure for change.  With the Coalition Government decline in the polls (in particular National) they are vulnerable to an en masse citizen's protest.
            </p>     
            <p>
                If the Coalition Government, in particular National, do not change their Maori preference ideology they will suffer in the 2026 election, we must give them a mandate to change their ideology.

            <p>
                And that 'somebody' is you, this site gives you the power to change things without doing anything other than joining up spreading the word and doing ‘Nothing’ during the strike.
