      title: "SEQUEL to the ETHNICITY EQUALISATION SCHEME",
      content: (
        <>
          <p>As a <strong>SEQUEL</strong> to the ETHNICITY EQUALISATION SCHEME article the question has been raised as to whether the Scheme could be applied to other race-based issues and the answer is ‘yes’ this certainly should be done, especially in relation to various race-based land and asset settlement deals.</p>
          <p>When you compare the 1967 and 1974 Maori Affairs Amendment Acts provisions you will note that the 1974 Act redefined “Maori” to mean a person of the Maori race and includes any descendant of such person. The change broadened the definition compared to the previous definition contained in the 1967 Act which relied on a specific blood line quantum such as being half caste or more. So why was that necessary? Well, by 1974 it looks like no one could meet the genuine half caste blood line criteria, so it became pressing to create the statutory fiction definition of “Maori” to satisfy the grievers and appeasers.</p>
          <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> On the basis of any International legitimate legal definition of race as opposed to the inane 1974 statutory fiction it appears that no one in New Zealand can claim to have 50% Maori ethnicity (extinct). It follows that with regard to the Maori Parliamentary seats created in 1867 then prospective candidates or voters would no longer qualify, thus, rendering these seats void and non-existent Anyway the seats should have been abolished long ago, certainly at the very latest with the advent of the 1993 MMP Legislation.</p>
          <p>The same argument applies to the iniquitous Maori ward representation on local authorities, race-based sports teams and even the current rort based Marine and Coastal Area Act 2011 (MACA) applications and so forth. The list is pretty well endless. Statutory Maori definition is a legal fiction that is costing New Zealanders $ billions of dollars.</p>
          <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Definitive DNA testing is the answer as it is the only reliable accurate legitimate process to give a proper assessment of eligibility.</p>

          <p>Many people are making valid protests about Waitangi claimants with very slight Maori bloodlines (ethnicity) and are looking for a formula on how to address this anomaly. Well here’s the solution; it’s called the <strong>Ethnicity Equalisation Scheme (EES)</strong>.</p>
          <p>For openers, we must address the quixotic definition of Maori in S.2 Maori Affairs Amendment Act 1974 which most sensible people consider to be farcical because this legal fiction seeks to create a statutory Maori race. If claimants are going to use any level of Maori ethnicity for Waitangi claims etc., then a scheme is required to have authenticated certified documents to ensure whakapapas are accurate, with Birth Certificates, Driver’s Licences and Passports, etc. endorsed, showing the degree of ethnicity attributed to claimants and this must be the minimum prerequisite requirement for obtaining any payments from Waitangi claims, etc. In addition, DNA testing would be mandatory.</p>
          <p>All this evidence to be actioned at the cost of the claimant.</p>
          <p>It follows that when looking at a tribe of say 2,000 ‘members’, there must be supporting documentation and evidence for each and every tribal member with lists made available for public inspection and then the ethnicity of the whole tribe must be averaged out.</p>
          <p>In a worked example, should the perceived grievance claim or any other claim (hard to take seriously) for some reason be successful and for example assessed at say $32 million, then if the average Maori ethnicity of the tribe is 1/8th,, the payment out would be only $4 million and the $28 million balance would be withheld along the same lines as the ‘contributory negligence doctrine’ to the extent of 7/8th representing the ethnicity percentage other than Maori and these funds should be returned to the NZ taxpayer via the Government, i.e, not paid out.</p>
          <p>That would be a fair and equitable outcome because taxpayers are entitled to know that all those who are claiming to be statutory Maori are really what they claim to be. They must provide accurate documentary proof because word of mouth mumbo jumbo is not good enough. If part-Maori don’t want such endorsement as to their ethnicity, they need not apply. The choice is theirs. Current assessments would indicate that no one can claim to have 50% Maori ethnicity; therefore the so-called Maori race exists only by statute that can be revoked by a 51% vote in Parliament. Other than by virtue of the statutory definition everyone in New Zealand must therefore currently be classified as non-Maori.</p>

          <p>(Excerpts)</p>
          <p>Given the recent series of ABYSMAL LEADERS WHO HAVE ARGUABLY LET THE COUNTRY DOWN so many ways....</p>
          <p>......CHRISTOPHER LUXON, FOR EXAMPLE -WHO IS PROVIDING A PRIME EXAMPLE OF APPEASING RADICAL ACTIVISTS, rather than representing a conservative majority – claims he does not support the Treaty Principles Bill because it is “divisive”. Indeed, HE WAS KEEN TO MEET WITH THE HIKOI, the so-call march in opposition led by radical activists even getting children removed from schools to swell their numbers.</p>
          <p>NOTHING COULD BE MORE DIVISIVE THAN LUXON’S IGNORING THE FEELING OF THE COUNTRY WHICH HAS HAD ENOUGH OF CULTURAL BULLYING, POSTURING, INTIMIDATION AND THREATS OF VIOLENCE BY A SMALL, BUT AGGRESSIVE MINORITY OF PART-MAORI DESCENT. He claims there is nothing in the bill that he likes, and that the National Party sees no need for it. Really? It is little wonder HIS SUPPORT IS AT AN ALL-TIME LOW. Most of us very much doubt that every member of the National Party caucus and membership would support what he says. They are far more likely to agree with the views of the highly respected Dr Elizabeth Rata, pointing out that New Zealand’s future may be that of A CHOICE BETWEEN A FIRST-WORLD, LIBERAL, PROSPEROUS DEMOCRACY OR A THIRD-WORLD, RETRIBALIZED STATE.</p>
          <p>That is the direction in which we are heading, given the radicalized bullying of what is basically cultural Marxism disguised under the cloak of the Maorification of this country. It is assisted by an activist media, tediously irritating the public by a pointless and excessive use of te Reo – which bears almost no relationship whatsoever to the genuine, original Maori language, but is simply largely invented – a fake language attempting in vain to parallel the use of English.</p>
          <p>This form of virtue signalling now has people increasingly switching off television viewing and fed up with the print media’s unnecessary and biassed focus on Maori issues. Moreover, the document “A Tiriti Framework for News Media” as produced by a group of left-wing academics funded by New Zealand on Air – originally compiled back in 2008, but then updated and revised under the Ardern government – was reissued as a guideline for the media, specifying issues that must be addressed at any reporting. We have been stuck ever since WITH A REPETITION OF UNTRUTHS to which the media were told they must subscribe, for example, arguing that Maori never ceded sovereignty to Britain or any other State; requiring the MSM to increase everyday use of te Reo in news items; and asking how these media organizations would change the dominance of Pakeha male commentators and sources.</p>
          <p>But meanwhile…THIS COALITION HAS LET US ALL DOWN. Its promise to restore the English names to all government departments and institutions so that the country can understand what they stand for has been completely ignored except, for the actions of then then minister Simeon Brown, who instructed the NZTA to do so. But behind his back the NZTA (grossly over-funded, given the always, ever-increasing unnecessary road signs erected beside our roads) continues to do so – and to answer the phone in te Reo. When I asked why this was the case, given that the first words the telephonist said were unintelligible, I was told he had been instructed to do so – a striking illustration of the way the largely left-wing bureaucracy has been solidly opposed to this present coalition from the beginning.</p>
          <p>But the LUXON GOVERNMENT HAS DONE NOTHING TO TACKLE THIS. Even Parliament’s phone is first answered in what I presume is te Reo. Why? Why the broken promises? Did they just lie when they campaigned on an undertaking to restore the English names – but are now coming up with excuses about the expense of doing so? Did they not state that THEY WOULD BE REJECTING CO GOVERNANCE – while now establishing it with undertakings as ridiculous as declaring that Mt Taranaki, the Whanganui river and Te Urewera are now legal persons -with the same rights as “other” human beings – and so need to be co-governed by local iwi and the Crown – naturally, with money somehow involved…</p>
          <p>.....Basically, given that most people of every race are conservative minded, want a stable society, protection for the family unit, an honest and accessible media allowing genuine debate – and a decent education for their children -free from the propaganda which our now Marxist Ministry of Education is inflicting on young New Zealanders – it’s obvious that we have no political party which basically represents the majority. Given that the far Left will never do, so the majority of New Zealanders are now feeling let down by this current coalition’s failure to represent their interests, and those of their children.</p>
          <p>So it is quite extraordinary and OF DEEP CONCERN THAT THE COUNTRY HAS FOUND THE LUXON-LED GOVERNMENT SO INADEQUATE IN RELATION TO ITS PROMISES that we are faced with the appalling prospect of a rerun of all the Ardern government was pushing. If an election were to be held now, a coalition of the far-Left would win- with even more disastrous consequences.</p>
          <p>GENUINE REFORM WILL ONLY OCCUR IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN NEW ZEALANDERS CAN HOLD THE GOVERNMENT TO ACCOUNT.....</p>

          <p>Open letter to Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, Government Ministers and all Coalition MPs</p>
          <p>Sixteen months have gone by since you were elected into office with a clear mandate for change: to correct the chaos left by the Labour Party, to stem wokeism, and to prevent the takeover of New Zealand by Maori tribalists.</p>
          <p>Sadly, there is very little evidence that you have begun to act on these very important parts of your Coalition agreement—to ‘end race-based policies.’ This was the unequivocal mandate you were given. Abuse it and you will be dealt with in the 2026 polls, just as NZ First was in 2020.</p>
          <p><strong>TAKE NOTE:</strong></p>
          <p>Throughout the country, the observation is that ordinary New Zealanders—the vast majority—are sick and tired, frustrated, and angry at your continuing appeasement of a minority mob of treasonous extremists. Your actions have about as much substance as the 1939 Neville Chamberlain appeasement with the Nazi regime in Germany.</p>
          <p>Mainstream New Zealanders (the Silent Majority) have had enough of the intimidation, the bullying and the aggression that emanates daily from opportunist tribalists.</p>
          <p>Heartland Kiwis are ‘sick’ of being forced to listen to a recently expanded language that they and many Maori don’t understand, and that has little or no value. They are ‘sick’ of te reo salutations. They are ‘sick’ of our law being corrupted by tikanga. They are ‘sick’ of treaty twisting, the fabrication of Treaty principles where none existed, dubious claims, forced co-governance, unnecessary name changes, the infiltration and corruption of bureaucracy, coastal seabed and foreshore claims, and the endless shovelling of money to elitist tribal coffers.</p>
          <p><strong>PROPOSED PROTEST ACTION</strong></p>
          <p>In the near future, the Silent Majority may choose a day to protest, and on this day, do absolutely nothing. NOTHING. Just like during Covid lockdowns, they’ll stay at home and do nothing. The only exception to this may be hospitals, police, ambulance, emergency services, petrol stations and supermarkets.</p>
          <p>Just think of the chaos that will cause, because of the Coalition Government’s facilitating of the fast progressing Maori takeover of New Zealand.</p>
          <p>No costly, disruptive street marches. No filling out pointless submissions to be read/heard by racially biased select committees. No petitions or time-consuming referendums that go nowhere.</p>
          <p>The Silent Majority will be heard demanding that politicians come to your senses and:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Remove all references to the Treaty of Waitangi or its so-called principles from all existing legislation. Accept that the Littlewood Draft which cross translates perfectly with Maori Te Tiriti is the final English draft of the Treaty of Waitangi.</li>
            <li>Abolish all race-based Parliamentary seats.</li>
            <li>Abolish all race-based representation on local bodies.</li>
            <li>Abolish the discredited Waitangi Tribunal.</li>
            <li>End treaty settlements.</li>
            <li>Withdraw from the 2001 United Nations Commission on Human Rights and discard the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</li>
            <li>Repeal the Marine and Coastal Area Act 2011 and restore the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004.</li>
            <li>Legislate for the Government to own and manage all freshwater resources.</li>
            <li>Affirm that there should be no change to the name of our country New Zealand or our flag without a binding referendum.</li>
            <li>Reassert one universal health authority with no racial discrimination permitted.</li>
            <li>Rescind the rewritten history curriculum.</li>
            <li>Remove all references to tikanga in New Zealand statutes and regulations.</li>
            <li>Remove recent Maori language from all Government signage buildings and communications (written or verbal).</li>
            <li>Restore English names to all public services so the average Kiwi and visitors understands what the service is about and who they are dealing with.</li>
            <li>Outlaw the flying of seditious Maori flags on public structures or in public places.</li>
            <li>Legislate for our common language, English, to be an official language of New Zealand.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following have been added to the original Open Letter (5 March 2025)</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Restore the true intended meaning of Te Tiriti and for the ceding of sovereignty by the chiefs once again be recognized as historical fact.</li>
            <li>Restore the punishment for sedition and treason.</li>
            <li>All past claims be scrutinized for fraudulent or unfounded claims and any settlement reversed that is proven to be a fraud or not built on evidence that would hold up In a court of law.</li>
            <li>Any settlement that was changed from full and final to be made final again and all ill gotten gains from the fraudulent extensions be returned to the NZ taxpayer.</li>
            <li>Iwi/Maori have to pay their own legal cost to make claims or challenge the Crown In court.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>A countrywide strike as proposed should not be taken lightly and would be a last resort attempt to get heard, and to get our country back on track. It will cause hardship and inconvenience to many in the short term, but that would be a small price to pay compared to losing our tried-and-true New Zealand democracy to dictatorial tribal control.</p>
          <p>We are actually facing a stealthy covert war and gradually being taken over by the enemy from within. Our enemy has no scruples and are supported by both the naïve and evil parts of our society.</p>
          <p>We have to fight fire with fire—but with more clout.</p>
          <p>Mainstream New Zealander's still have the power; we just need to apply it in a united manner to turn the good ship New Zealand around for future generations.</p>
          <p><strong>BEING NICE WON’T DEFEAT THE TRIBALIST LUST FOR POWER AND CONTROL</strong></p>
