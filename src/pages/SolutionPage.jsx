        The Solution
      </h2>

      <div className="paragraph-text"> 
        <p>
          This 'solution' can be achieved in two (2) steps:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mt-6 mb-2">Step 1:</h3>
        <p>
          Is primarily about obtaining enough 'signatures' to gauge if New Zealand has the ‘appetite’ for a protest of this type.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mt-6 mb-2">Step 2:</h3>
        <p>
          Is to have nationwide <b>Do Nothing Days</b> protests/strikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is proposed that a day is chosen for all New Zealanders who oppose the dismantling of democracy in favour of ethno-political rule to ‘Do Nothing’ - yes that is correct, do NOTHING, don’t go to work, businesses etc close, just stay at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only exceptions to this are Hospitals, Ambulances, Emergency services, Petrol Stations and Supermarkets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just think of the chaos that will cause, because of the Coalition Government’s facilitating of the fast progressing transfer of national authority to unelected iwi elites.
        </p>
        <p>
          No costly, disruptive street marches. No filling out pointless submissions to be read/heard by racially biased select committees. No petitions or time-consuming referendums that go nowhere.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold">
          The Silent Majority will be heard demanding that politicians come to their senses.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold">
          Bring New Zealand to a standstill until politicians meet our terms (below)
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mt-8 mb-2 uppercase">Operation/Execution:</h3>
        <p>
          Choose a strategic day in the future, promote it well with plenty of warning for citizens to plan their affairs for it, and for politicians to learn what is going to happen should they not meet the terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to the <b>Do Nothing Days</b>, New Zealanders including workers and businesses etc will be encouraged to pressure their local MP to meet the terms early to avoid the <b>Do Nothing Days</b> protest/strike.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mt-8 mb-2 uppercase">Terms / Demands - Requiring Parliament to:</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
          <li>Remove all references to the Treaty of Waitangi or its so-called principles from all existing legislation.</li>
          <li>Abolish all race-based Parliamentary seats now.</li>

          <li>Reassert one universal health authority while scrapping the Maori Health Authority.</li>
          <li>Rescind the rewritten history curriculum in schools.</li>
          <li>Remove all reference to tikanga in New Zealand statutes and regulations.</li>
          <li>Remove Maori language from all Government signage and communications (written or verbal)</li>
          <li>Restore English names to all public services so the average Kiwi understands what the service is about and who they are dealing with.</li>
          <li>Outlaw the flying of seditious Maori flags in the public square.</li>
          <li>Legislate, to provide for our common language, English as an official language of New Zealand.</li>
          <li>Remove all references and requirements in the RMA for landowners / developers to have to consult with Maori tribes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="font-bold mt-6">The following have been added to the original Open Letter (5 March 2025)</p>
        <ul className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
          <li>Restore the true intended meaning of Te Tiriti and for the ceding of sovereignty by the chiefs once again be recognized as historical fact.</li>
          <li>Restore the punishment for sedition and treason.</li>
          <li>All past claims be scrutinized for fraudulent or unfounded claims and any settlement reversed that is proven to be a fraud or not built on evidence that would hold up In a court of law.</li>
          <li>Any settlement that was changed from full and final to be made final again and all ill gotten gains from the fraudulent extensions be returned to the NZ taxpayer.</li>
          <li>Iwi/Maori have to pay their own legal cost to make claims or challenge the Crown In court</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mt-8">
          I believe that without some action as revolutionary as the above, New Zealand will fall under full race-based control in the not to distant future - street marches, referendums, petitions, submissions have all proven to be ineffective. We simply have to use more clout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The silent majority will get nowhere while we play by 'their' rules - so we change the rules of engagement.
